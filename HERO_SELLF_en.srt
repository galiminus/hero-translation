0
00:00:05,595 --> 00:00:06,266
let me put it,

1
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:10,023
the forest are like home to me.

2
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:14,107
You know, it's somewhere I can just go to sit

3
00:01:14,277 --> 00:01:15,218
and think

4
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:17,780
it helps relieve a lot of stress.

5
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:25,858
I've always kind of struggled with breathing

6
00:01:26,578 --> 00:01:32,464
and it's gotten worse. You know, I thought I had asthma at first, but I didn't.

7
00:01:33,274 --> 00:01:35,006
So I just went in

8
00:01:35,506 --> 00:01:36,237
and

9
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:40,681
you know, they said that I had a tumor that was cancerous.

10
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:44,735
I want to say I was 22 or 23.

11
00:01:45,996 --> 00:01:46,746
So

12
00:01:47,477 --> 00:01:52,071
obviously that's pretty young to be diagnosed or something like that.

13
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:54,924
It changed a lot of stuff for me,

14
00:01:58,597 --> 00:02:01,220
A lot of people in my family have cancer.

15
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:06,334
I'm going through the same radiologist that my grandma went through.

16
00:02:10,308 --> 00:02:13,561
I went through a couple rounds of chemotherapy

17
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:17,694
and I was pretty much told it's not working,

18
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:20,127
we're gonna have to

19
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:26,002
either take you in for surgery within this week or you're not gonna make it.

20
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:26,562
So that was like,

21
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:29,745
my first life expectancy that I was given was either

22
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:32,117
do the surgery or die within a couple of weeks.

23
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:36,431
Yes.

24
00:02:37,622 --> 00:02:39,564
So I had the surgery,

25
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:42,947
there's no cancer in my lungs anymore.

26
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:47,461
But before I had the surgery, it had spread.

27
00:02:48,722 --> 00:02:49,523
So

28
00:02:50,454 --> 00:02:52,055
today I haven't really

29
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,700
done much chemo mainly because of health care.

30
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,553
I lost my health care when I switched jobs and I haven't gotten any since

31
00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:09,641
when I got that diagnosis, I was at a very low point in my life.

32
00:03:10,332 --> 00:03:14,896
It wasn't like, oh, wow, I need to change this. It was like, oh, wow, I can finally die.

33
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:20,541
It was my friends that really brought me back.

34
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:32,882
I reached out into the fandom and I made my friend major.

35
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:38,307
It's just fun to meet new people and that's really what I want to do in the fandom.

36
00:03:46,054 --> 00:03:50,418
I think we all have those moments in the fandom where we contemplate leaving it.

37
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:53,041
I've had that moment when I got that diagnosis,

38
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:57,645
is this really doing anything for my life other than costing me money to get art.

39
00:03:57,655 --> 00:04:02,499
But the answer was, yes, it was doing something for my life.

40
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:06,763
I'm so nervous about presenting this right now.

41
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:08,655
I'm always in here.

42
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:11,547
I'm shaking. I'm like shaking.

43
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:13,129
Oh,

44
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:22,337
seeing the way that suits kind of change people and the way that suits

45
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:25,720
can bring other people joy is kind of what made me want one.

46
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,443
I can put a smile on someone's face and not

47
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:33,607
risk losing my job for not being a straight male

48
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:41,885
Euro hood.

49
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:46,058
So this is like a partially painted head, but this is his head

50
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:53,445
getting into first suiting making a fruit suits was,

51
00:04:53,455 --> 00:04:56,077
it was kind of a random thing that I actually got into it.

52
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,949
Uh prior to doing this,

53
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:00,982
I had my own printing business that I've known for a lot of years

54
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:04,445
when I received a city that was made by cyber.

55
00:05:04,455 --> 00:05:07,338
That was an incredibly special thing to me.

56
00:05:08,118 --> 00:05:12,582
It really, really impacted me in so many ways and it completely transformed my life

57
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:16,276
and I wanted to be a part of that create

58
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:19,899
these things that bring such joy and happiness to everybody.

59
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:39,797
I sold my previous business that gave me the capital to start this up.

60
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,239
Every suit that I do is slightly different.

61
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:45,232
I'm always looking at, how can I improve it? How can I make it better?

62
00:05:45,822 --> 00:05:47,684
Oh, don't do that.

63
00:05:56,652 --> 00:05:58,664
So the suit that we're working on is hero,

64
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:02,057
everything seemed normal business as usual.

65
00:06:02,147 --> 00:06:04,920
Then out of the blue, I had a couple of people that poked me.

66
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,504
It's like, hey, we'd like for you to put heroes commission in front of ours.

67
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:14,709
So I didn't know any story on, I had no knowledge of what it was but upon, you know,

68
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:16,820
kind of poking these people and getting more information

69
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,582
and learning of his story is just like,

70
00:06:18,582 --> 00:06:22,005
oh my gosh, he needs to have that suit much sooner.

71
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:24,567
So I use a piece of software

72
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:26,759
where this is not him.

73
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,373
I'll take the measurements and I can basically

74
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:32,665
plug those measurements into the software to go ahead

75
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:36,318
and create all of the lines that we're gonna need on this to create the pattern.

76
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:40,712
The software then largely converts it over here to the two dimensional side.

77
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:43,655
Then I will output this pattern. I'll print this pattern out.

78
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:57,657
Most vinyl cutters just only cut the vinyl.

79
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,351
This machine is actually cutting the vinyl and the paper so we can be able to pull

80
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:03,623
those pieces out and then Tetris them on the

81
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,474
food to get the best utilization of the foot

82
00:07:05,955 --> 00:07:09,568
because otherwise trying to figure that out, it's just too much brain damage.

83
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:10,659
This is just easier

84
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,340
and see this is going to be

85
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,942
black luxury shag

86
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:42,087
and this piece down here, this is going to be white arctic fox, laugh,

87
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:45,501
this is going to be gray, arctic fox.

88
00:07:51,606 --> 00:07:55,620
Typical turnaround from the time that I start the suit until the

89
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,632
suit is done is usually in the neighborhood of about two months.

90
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:03,557
I definitely put this suit on the express path simply because

91
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:07,200
the biggest thing he's fighting is time, it's, you know, the unknown.

92
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:10,313
I worry about if he's gonna like the suit,

93
00:08:10,914 --> 00:08:14,857
you're creating something that is this person's idea of who they are.

94
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:19,902
Am I actually doing that? Am I, am I able to to achieve what he was hoping that

95
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:20,632
it would be,

96
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:25,176
he's actually coming out here next monday as a

97
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:27,619
matter of fact to take delivery of the suit?

98
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:30,661
Uh this is something I normally don't do.

99
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:33,784
It's kind of a little bit, you know, it's a bit of an unprecedented situation.

100
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:37,777
We're gonna have this thing done by monday and it's kind of all hands on deck,

101
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:38,989
getting the suit complete.

102
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:12,269
I was working a corporate job that I really did not like and

103
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:15,972
my sister saw an ad on next door that was like costume maker,

104
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:20,016
somebody with so many experience preferred, which have a seamstress.

105
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,249
So I came thinking that it was probably for,

106
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:25,050
there's like a little theater in the town here.

107
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,223
So I thought I would be like making costumes for the theater.

108
00:09:28,223 --> 00:09:31,917
And then I come to the interview and Ryan's like, what do you know about Ferraris?

109
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:34,779
Didn't know that much. Now I know much more.

110
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:38,743
I know a lot more work goes into it than I would have previously thought

111
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:41,135
to the firm

112
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,537
and I bring this,

113
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:46,730
so

114
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:49,122
could be this.

115
00:09:54,937 --> 00:09:56,689
I didn't know this business existed.

116
00:09:56,689 --> 00:09:58,841
I didn't know that there was an industry for this.

117
00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:02,144
We were doing a family walk with our daughter and the

118
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:05,347
dogs one day and Ryan was outside and he says,

119
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:06,228
are you looking for work?

120
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:09,581
And I said, yes. And so he said, would you like to work at wagon?

121
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:10,992
And I said, what's Magarri

122
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:25,555
I interviewed with him and he told me all about the business and I started working.

123
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:31,130
What I love the most is when all the heads are in

124
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,964
here and I can try them on when I'm working and stuff.

125
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:37,976
But I love when all the heads are in here because you kind of make that

126
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:44,022
connection with the body because a lot of times there's just bodies and no heads.

127
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:48,986
So it's really neat when you can kind of get a feel for the character of that person.

128
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:52,319
There's so many projects going at one time typically that trying

129
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:56,113
to keep each project straight in your head is often difficult.

130
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,595
I would say this is probably like the fourth

131
00:10:58,595 --> 00:11:00,587
most complex suit I've done since I've been here,

132
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:03,930
Maybe 150-200 pieces

133
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,373
just for the body. Then the head is a lot of smaller pieces too.

134
00:11:08,664 --> 00:11:10,226
We were, I was looking at

135
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,968
the map out of the body with Corey and trying

136
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:15,971
to figure out are these random pieces or do these,

137
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:19,064
I think these are those triangles that we did off the back for the foot, pause,

138
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:22,387
what I'm seeing on the pattern does not match what I'm seeing.

139
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:24,809
Let's see here,

140
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:28,922
this is this one here.

141
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:32,656
This one goes in here and this one goes here and this goes in here,

142
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:35,568
let's see here. What is that? So these are

143
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,700
this top one that that's definitely,

144
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,273
yeah, that one is definitely not right.

145
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:43,906
So we got some pieces that are missing for this project

146
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:44,997
and

147
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:48,860
if they don't get put in the right place, then it's a problem.

148
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,772
Everybody looking all around for something.

149
00:11:52,163 --> 00:11:54,235
Here we go, No, that's not it.

150
00:12:09,1000 --> 00:12:12,572
Part of fighting cancer is having support,

151
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:18,037
You need a support network and feeling like nobody wanted me,

152
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,580
it was just impossible.

153
00:12:23,382 --> 00:12:27,806
I pretty much just lost everything. I stopped doing chemo.

154
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:31,279
I stopped caring, my job performance went to ship.

155
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,371
I gave up

156
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:39,406
and then there was the whole thing with my grandma when she got diagnosed,

157
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:43,260
she's the only one that I ever told about it that I had it.

158
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,463
I remember her saying, you know, I don't want to bury my grandson.

159
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:52,718
You know I'm only 22,, she's 70

160
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:55,851
and she just cried and

161
00:12:56,872 --> 00:12:58,583
that just kind of left me.

162
00:12:58,593 --> 00:12:59,044
You know,

163
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:02,257
you feel like a piece of sh it when you give up just

164
00:13:02,257 --> 00:13:05,370
on your whole life and you're gonna hurt all these people around you.

165
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:11,235
She had colon cancer

166
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:15,689
radiologist had told her she was in remission so she had beat it

167
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,144
and then she went back and they said yeah you're stage four,

168
00:13:21,154 --> 00:13:24,297
you're gonna be you have five months at the most.

169
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:28,991
And she died like a week later

170
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:38,209
she wanted to meet my friend major because I told her a lot about him and he

171
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:43,554
agreed to fly up and then she ended up passing a couple of days before he came

172
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:46,206
instead of canceling.

173
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:51,411
He flew all the way from florida to salt lake to come to her funeral with me.

174
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:56,025
Her passing is literally the hardest I've ever cried in

175
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:58,087
my life and my best friend had to see it.

176
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:05,194
But to me that prove he was in it for the long haul and that he was just irreplaceable.

177
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:10,088
And I've never had friendships like that outside of this fandom.

178
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:13,011
You know internet friendships can be real friendships,

179
00:14:21,098 --> 00:14:22,870
We use this room for doing the 3D.

180
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,594
Printing all of the mold, pouring all the resin work that we do just for claws

181
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:31,057
and we do all the airbrushing.

182
00:14:31,577 --> 00:14:35,001
We basically used this room to get away from the for for and

183
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:38,954
three d printers don't mix well for and resin molds don't mix well.

184
00:14:38,964 --> 00:14:41,907
So this effectively kind of becomes our

185
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:43,048
clean room

186
00:14:57,661 --> 00:15:01,514
but we have this set up and then we also have a third machine over here

187
00:15:01,915 --> 00:15:04,237
and this machine just got finished putting these

188
00:15:05,808 --> 00:15:08,551
so these are completed set of teeth and I,

189
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:10,392
so what we do is go in here and clean off all the,

190
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:12,224
the goobers

191
00:15:14,116 --> 00:15:16,268
and remove all of the support material.

192
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:29,930
A few little goobers to fix but

193
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:32,442
overall pretty good

194
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:53,842
here at Wagah re costumes. I am in charge of building the heads

195
00:15:53,962 --> 00:15:57,765
and just about everything that is involved with that.

196
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,284
I've always been a painter drawer sculptor out of school.

197
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:12,669
I've dove right into the gallery business and got to learn a lot about fine art,

198
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:17,153
started my own business providing services for artists,

199
00:16:17,153 --> 00:16:22,107
galleries and museums basically got burnt out on that

200
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:25,240
and I was desperate to find something unique.

201
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,952
That's how I met Ryan

202
00:16:27,532 --> 00:16:31,316
came for an interview and he explained furry to me

203
00:16:31,436 --> 00:16:32,367
and

204
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:33,948
I started the next day.

205
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:38,892
My kids knew what it was.

206
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:44,157
They were surprised that I wanted to do this.

207
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:48,351
I kind of just like the sheer playfulness of it.

208
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:50,823
It kind of seems like a

209
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:55,598
a nice way to just to get out of yourself.

210
00:16:55,608 --> 00:17:01,463
People who might be extremely shy or might have some social anxieties.

211
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:06,747
It's kind of a tool for dealing with that. It's really interesting

212
00:17:24,153 --> 00:17:27,476
flocking is something that's been around for a very, very long time.

213
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:31,190
Typically where you see it is like an in car interior looking your center console.

214
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,711
It's kind of fuzzy lined in there.

215
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:36,895
Uh This was just a way for us to be able to create a very matte black look of

216
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:40,048
something, but also because their first suits, they want to be fuzzy.

217
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,749
These will complete out the eye.

218
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,685
Right now. I have 33 d printers. Uh two of these machines are larger.

219
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:49,837
They're used for doing all of the molds.

220
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:52,029
So because whenever we're needing, we steal this.

221
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:58,104
I sculpt a positive in the software from that positive,

222
00:17:58,104 --> 00:18:00,977
I generate a negative and that's what we print is the negatives.

223
00:18:00,987 --> 00:18:03,639
So that way, these are, these are clamshells

224
00:18:05,691 --> 00:18:06,762
that comes together.

225
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:11,246
We put the foam in here. The head bus goes down, the foam expands into the head bust

226
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:40,122
The phone we're gonna use expands 15 times

227
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:51,142
Part B is the resin and the part A is really the activator.

228
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:56,637
You only have 35 seconds

229
00:18:56,877 --> 00:18:58,318
as soon as they touch each other.

230
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:22,030
Now the foam is expanding and I want to just keep pressure

231
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,902
on this

232
00:19:26,134 --> 00:19:30,067
From the design to the printing to the prep.

233
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:34,081
You know, you're, you're talking a good 10 hours

234
00:19:35,532 --> 00:19:38,305
and then these, but the molds take,

235
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:40,757
you know, nearly a day and a half to print

236
00:19:41,487 --> 00:19:43,229
if you let it sit too long.

237
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:44,340
Um

238
00:19:46,132 --> 00:19:49,084
the mold can really stick to the foam and then you've got to,

239
00:19:49,284 --> 00:19:51,326
you've got kind of a disaster.

240
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,611
You know, in half an hour it'll be

241
00:19:58,183 --> 00:19:59,594
the tackiness will be gone.

242
00:20:09,863 --> 00:20:12,105
Hero is part of me

243
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:13,166
and he is,

244
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,427
you know me,

245
00:20:15,338 --> 00:20:20,853
but at the same time it's what he represents that matters to me.

246
00:20:23,115 --> 00:20:23,806
That's hero

247
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:30,572
screenshots

248
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:35,837
the name hero comes from a wolf dog at Spring Creek. Wolf dogs

249
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:40,040
working with him gave me a little more hope in life.

250
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,524
You know, it made me feel like I had a friend when I was in a situation that

251
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:46,496
I didn't know anyone.

252
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:52,301
The design for hero is actually from another wolf dog named thatcher.

253
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:54,864
I just kind of took the color palette from him.

254
00:20:55,775 --> 00:20:58,897
Hero is a werewolf. He's a werewolf.

255
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,663
The inspiration for that came from my childhood living with my dad

256
00:21:06,354 --> 00:21:10,248
Ford Duchenne is kind of known as the skin walker ranch.

257
00:21:10,258 --> 00:21:14,952
There's a lot of reports of UFO sightings and werewolf sightings

258
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:18,905
and my dad claimed to study a lot of this stuff.

259
00:21:19,556 --> 00:21:21,458
I hadn't talked to him for a while

260
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:23,039
and the last time he had heard from me,

261
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,222
we got in a fight and I said something like I hate you

262
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:27,904
and

263
00:21:28,804 --> 00:21:30,686
you know, I've never got to say goodbye.

264
00:21:31,036 --> 00:21:31,747
So

265
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:39,634
that's kind of what made me choose a werewolf is my character.

266
00:21:40,085 --> 00:21:43,167
That was a way for me to channel some of him

267
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:45,690
and ultimately that's what hero is.

268
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,013
It's just kind of a combination of people in my life

269
00:21:49,113 --> 00:21:52,085
that you know, change who you are as a person

270
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:56,710
he represents, showing people that you're not alone in the world,

271
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,963
despite how hard things get, you can't just lose hope.

272
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:13,265
We got G. F. That's this one.

273
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,086
This is black mink

274
00:22:15,957 --> 00:22:18,379
Gaff, laugh

275
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:20,071
when I didn't mark

276
00:22:22,563 --> 00:22:23,404
cf.

277
00:22:25,586 --> 00:22:28,658
See if I can find any white super seal.

278
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:34,043
Okay, It looks like I have to pull that off the roll

279
00:22:35,535 --> 00:22:36,455
two bags

280
00:22:37,737 --> 00:22:38,467
21st

281
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,681
with heroes head.

282
00:22:42,691 --> 00:22:46,414
His rough sheets show very snarly or you know mean type

283
00:22:46,414 --> 00:22:49,547
of wolf type of thing and very intense and he's like,

284
00:22:49,557 --> 00:22:52,800
well, in reality, I don't want to be that, you know, it's like,

285
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,594
I'm not that person is like my artwork shows that, but you know,

286
00:22:56,594 --> 00:22:59,586
as far as who I'm going to be in suit, that's not really who I am.

287
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:02,119
So, it's one of those scenarios of where it's like, okay, well,

288
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,650
given what his character is,

289
00:23:04,741 --> 00:23:06,373
whether it's the suit that I'm doing here for

290
00:23:06,373 --> 00:23:08,695
hero or pretty much any suit that we make.

291
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:12,448
The head is really kind of the key piece

292
00:23:12,578 --> 00:23:14,530
is what gives the suit of Soul

293
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:32,626
two down.

294
00:23:33,937 --> 00:23:35,289
Who knows how many more to go.

295
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,362
This is the tedious part of doing this, but

296
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:42,675
the time is not spent to do it right.

297
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:45,208
The end result does not come out very good.

298
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:07,788
I am

299
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:10,811
just trying to match up what

300
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:12,472
kind of goes where

301
00:24:14,064 --> 00:24:15,545
this is the arm right now.

302
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:22,581
When I'm working on a first suit, I mainly do the sewing and assembly of the pieces.

303
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:25,954
First suits are a lot different than sewing

304
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:28,617
clothing or household items or other things.

305
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:31,189
And I'm learning to use machines.

306
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:34,913
I've never used a lot more hardware that I've never installed.

307
00:24:35,043 --> 00:24:38,015
There's just a lot more that goes into it than I've done sewing before.

308
00:24:40,387 --> 00:24:41,458
Working on Hero suit.

309
00:24:41,468 --> 00:24:43,600
I've been paying a lot more attention to the detail

310
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,792
and trying to make sure it's exactly what he wants.

311
00:24:48,825 --> 00:24:50,026
I hope it makes him really happy.

312
00:24:51,027 --> 00:24:54,400
This is the chest. We use coil zippers so we can cut them

313
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,542
as long as we need.

314
00:24:57,883 --> 00:25:01,517
It's super satisfying to see a big table full of fluff

315
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:05,300
pieces come together into something that actually looks like a suit.

316
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:10,124
And the hum of the sewing machine is one of the most relaxing noises.

317
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:28,401
It is not very fun with thread.

318
00:25:33,495 --> 00:25:34,476
This is supposed to

319
00:25:35,657 --> 00:25:36,018
know.

320
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:38,610
Yeah,

321
00:25:44,345 --> 00:25:45,556
these things are such a

322
00:25:45,857 --> 00:25:47,018
fiddly missed.

323
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,512
Your fault fails, read the man,

324
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,021
make sure

325
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:06,836
and about to put the claws in Hero's hand pots.

326
00:26:07,376 --> 00:26:12,751
And these are the claws that have been pre made by James and these are resin claws.

327
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:13,802
They're really cool.

328
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:24,812
It's a little bit like magic to me. I don't really understand all of it.

329
00:26:24,822 --> 00:26:28,025
Um but there's all these little bloopers in here.

330
00:26:28,035 --> 00:26:31,138
There's a knife right here that comes down and cuts the

331
00:26:31,138 --> 00:26:35,562
for and as that's being cut all the loops form these loops

332
00:26:36,412 --> 00:26:41,147
around the edge. So that's a super secure stitch. It's not going anywhere,

333
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,490
put my safety guard down. So I don't

334
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:47,042
cut my fingers off.

335
00:26:57,501 --> 00:26:59,683
And then there's another line on the other side.

336
00:27:08,471 --> 00:27:10,323
This is one of my favorite parts.

337
00:27:34,335 --> 00:27:34,815
So

338
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:44,604
nice Hero

339
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,647
222.

340
00:28:58,631 --> 00:29:00,232
He was talking to me about saying, well

341
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:04,376
if this is not made by the time I, by the time I passed away,

342
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,729
then we'll give it to a friend of mine. And I just like

343
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,360
that's heavy,

344
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:11,522
that was really heavy

345
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:20,310
and it made me realize that he needs, he needs to experience what I experienced. And

346
00:29:22,632 --> 00:29:23,453
so that's,

347
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:26,556
that's why I wanted to bring him to the front

348
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,419
of the queue and make this happen because he's just

349
00:29:32,311 --> 00:29:34,303
Life is short and

350
00:29:34,763 --> 00:29:38,417
I mean he's 24 and I'm I'm 46. Let's see.

351
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,182
You realize

352
00:29:47,455 --> 00:29:50,458
life is an experience, a gift. It's a gift of experiences.

353
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:55,472
It seems like something so silly.

354
00:29:55,472 --> 00:29:58,765
It seems like something, it's like it's, it's a mask, it's a costume,

355
00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:01,648
but it really is something so much more than that.

356
00:30:01,658 --> 00:30:06,362
And that's that's was the realization that I, I had when I, when I got to see

357
00:30:07,923 --> 00:30:08,764
the suit

358
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:10,936
gives him to be the best self he is.

359
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:14,069
But essentially, but this also represents him as the best self that he is.

360
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,231
So I'm definitely, you know,

361
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:20,565
putting that extra energy into making this be as amazing as possible.

362
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:33,967
I was really touched by what Ryan offered to do.

363
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:37,900
It makes me feel like we're not just making first suits.

364
00:30:38,661 --> 00:30:42,415
It's nice to have your work mean that much.

365
00:31:45,562 --> 00:31:46,853
You nearly got away.

366
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:55,841
The back looks cool. It's cool to see it like so Oh wow, look at that.

367
00:32:02,657 --> 00:32:04,329
I love this. But here's my paper

368
00:32:20,553 --> 00:32:22,235
really at the end of the day.

369
00:32:22,265 --> 00:32:26,449
These are people that I will see at cons over and over again

370
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:29,431
and I want to see them having fun.

371
00:32:32,204 --> 00:32:37,509
Today is basically uh, we're going to see what all are we going to do.

372
00:32:40,942 --> 00:32:43,194
I think we're gonna be ready to go ahead and glue for onto the head.

373
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:57,066
You gotta get the nose finished up. So I've got a pattern of the nose,

374
00:33:03,452 --> 00:33:04,953
get the teeth installed,

375
00:33:09,547 --> 00:33:10,688
create a tongue

376
00:33:14,802 --> 00:33:17,214
after. That will be some shaving.

377
00:33:31,918 --> 00:33:33,829
Then it's going to be the eyes

378
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:41,036
airbrushing.

379
00:33:57,281 --> 00:34:02,936
It's not just a business, this is a passion, this is me creating the things,

380
00:34:02,946 --> 00:34:06,679
something that I love and something that gave me such happiness

381
00:34:06,689 --> 00:34:08,741
and being able to recreate this and do this for,

382
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:09,772
for others.

383
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:22,844
There's a squirrel.

384
00:34:31,812 --> 00:34:33,072
Yeah, I got two areas

385
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:36,356
now. The

386
00:34:37,387 --> 00:34:38,258
studio here

387
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:39,117
basically,

388
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,992
most of the assembly occurs. So

389
00:34:43,322 --> 00:34:45,694
we've got all the first storage up here at the sewing machines,

390
00:34:45,704 --> 00:34:47,516
all of that building and then I actually finished.

391
00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:51,720
I don't even know what to expect when I go in there and see it for the first time.

392
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:57,775
I tend to bottle a lot of stuff up. I don't express myself very much.

393
00:34:57,784 --> 00:35:05,622
I'm hoping it just helps me be less like socially awkward and engage more with people

394
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:10,006
to put a face to the animal.

395
00:35:11,227 --> 00:35:13,059
Hey, good to meet you.

396
00:35:15,271 --> 00:35:17,913
We three d print these and then essentially

397
00:35:18,304 --> 00:35:19,435
supply wax too.

398
00:35:22,608 --> 00:35:27,322
He is way outdone himself and I'm saying that now before I even see the thing.

399
00:35:38,612 --> 00:35:39,683
Oh man.

400
00:35:46,049 --> 00:35:47,220
Oh man,

401
00:35:49,072 --> 00:35:52,014
you did an incredible job with that.

402
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:00,092
Oh man,

403
00:36:07,368 --> 00:36:08,920
you did so good on this.

404
00:36:12,543 --> 00:36:13,354
Thank you.

405
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:18,528
Thank you.

406
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,850
Give it a try.

407
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,681
Yeah. Yeah.

408
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:05,661
I want to give you a hug and

409
00:37:06,451 --> 00:37:12,167
the airbrush on you, get your face. Oh, you look wonderful. This is my favorite.

410
00:37:13,348 --> 00:37:14,409
You're my favorite.

411
00:37:30,663 --> 00:37:31,384
We did it.

412
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,234
Honestly, it's gonna be a long time before I really know how to feel about it.

413
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:55,596
It's been

414
00:37:56,176 --> 00:37:57,958
pretty emotional. Honestly,

415
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:00,090
just seeing,

416
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:00,741
you know,

417
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:03,153
something that means so much to me and something that

418
00:38:03,153 --> 00:38:06,596
represents so much brought to life in that much detail

419
00:38:07,617 --> 00:38:10,149
is just incredible.

420
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:14,693
I still don't even know like how to process any of it.

421
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:16,295
Even being here.

422
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:17,786
It's just

423
00:38:18,517 --> 00:38:20,769
everything changed so quickly.

424
00:38:21,189 --> 00:38:22,750
Everything happened so quickly.

425
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,812
I want to use it for charity events.

426
00:38:35,812 --> 00:38:40,727
Like I've had ideas to do it for primary Children's Hospital or for

427
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:46,162
Huntsman Cancer Institute where I'm going help kids make personas or something.

428
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:50,085
Ultimately the goal is to just make people's days brighter.

429
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:57,202
I never expected to get diagnosed with cancer

430
00:38:57,982 --> 00:39:01,806
ever. Despite how bad it's been.

431
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:02,076
You know,

432
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:04,708
it's still shaped me to who I am today and

433
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:07,881
I think that if I didn't have those experiences,

434
00:39:09,002 --> 00:39:10,914
I don't think I'd be

435
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:15,388
as good of a person honestly. You know, I think it's kind of

436
00:39:16,129 --> 00:39:17,550
showing me how to be more

437
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,572
sympathetic to people.

438
00:39:20,182 --> 00:39:24,947
I've learned a lot about the power of the people that you have in your lives,

439
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:29,651
like the impact that they can have on you and coming here

440
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:32,634
even has had a huge impact on me and it's made me

441
00:39:33,494 --> 00:39:37,078
even want to fight it even more than I did before.

442
00:39:37,088 --> 00:39:39,960
It's scary and it's not just like my family,

443
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,294
but cancer rates in the United States or even skyrocketing.

444
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:51,050
And a lot of it is due to the lack of access to health care, an ambulance, right?

445
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:51,571
Is like,

446
00:39:52,321 --> 00:39:54,053
it costs more than a burial,

447
00:39:55,114 --> 00:39:55,764
so

448
00:39:57,136 --> 00:40:00,419
no one should have to choose between dying or being in debt.

449
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:18,085
If you have a positive outlook on life, it changes who you are.

450
00:40:18,095 --> 00:40:21,298
I want to give back to the fandom what the fandom gave me,

451
00:40:21,308 --> 00:40:26,592
which was quite possibly a second opportunity at life.

452
00:40:26,602 --> 00:40:29,705
I personally don't think that I'm a very memorable person.

453
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:32,077
You know, you might think otherwise,

454
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,119
but I just,

455
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:34,990
I

456
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,252
want to do my part. I guess
